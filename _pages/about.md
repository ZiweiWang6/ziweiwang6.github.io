I am currently an assistant professor in  School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, and also the director of Perception and Embodied Intelligence (PINE) Lab. Before joining NTU, I was a postdoc fellow in Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University with Prof. Changliu Liu. I received the Ph.D degree from the Department of Automation, Tsinghua University in 2023, supervised by Prof. Jiwen Lu. I obtained my B.S. degree in Tsinghua University in 2018. My research interests include computer vision, machine learning and robotics.
