I am currently an assistant professor in  School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, and also the director of [Perception and Embodied Intelligence (PINE) Lab](https://pineatntu.hithub.io). Before joining NTU, I was a postdoc fellow in Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University with [Prof. Changliu Liu](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cliu6/index.html). I received the Ph.D degree from the Department of Automation, Tsinghua University in 2023, supervised by [Prof. Jiwen Lu](http://ivg.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/Jiwen_Lu/). I obtained my B.S. degree in Tsinghua University in 2018. My research interests include computer vision, machine learning and robotics.

If you are interested in joining our lab, please don't hesitate to drop me an email at ziweiwa2@andrew.cmu.edu with your CV.
